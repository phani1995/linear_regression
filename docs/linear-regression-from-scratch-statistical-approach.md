# Linear Regression from Scratch Statistical Approach



## The Theory

Linear Regression is the process of fitting a line to the dataset.

## Single Variable Linear Regression

## The Mathematics

The equation of Line is

Where,
 y = dependent variable
 X = independent variable
C = intercept 

The algorithm is trying to fit a line to the data by adjusting the values of m and c. Its Objective is to attain to a value of m such that for any given value of x it would be properly predicting the value of y.

There are various ways in which we can attain the values of m and c 

* Statistical approach
* Iterative approach

In this post we are discussing Statistical approach. If you find the derivation too long you can take look ar final m and c formulas.
We were given data, set of x and y values and we were asked to find a line which best fits that which means mathematically we should be able to fine the slope and c values of the line to describe the line.
The derivation to the slope and intercept values of the line
The equation of the Line is

Which means for a particular value of x, let us say xi the value of y would be yi = m*xi + c
For x1 value of x y1 value of y is obtained,
For x2 value of x y2 value of y is obtained,
And goes on 
On summating all these values into one equation, it can be written as,


The objective is to solve equation 1 and 2 to attain the values of c and m
On solving the c term in Equation 1, it can also be written as,

Rewriting it as,

Substituting the value of m in Equation 2

Now only c is there in Equation 3, solving for c 
Step1,

Step2,

Step 3,

On multiplying both numerator and denominator by -1


To calculate the value of m taking the value of c and substituting in Equation -1,

Equation 4 have only one parameter m, so solving for m,

On expanding RHS and cancelling terms, 

The value of m,


The values of c and m are,



We use the m and c formulas obtained in derivation in the code.

## The Dataset 

Dataset consists of two columns namely X and y
Where

For List Price Vs. Best Price for a New GMC Pickup dataset
X = List price (in $1000) for a GMC pickup truck
Y = Best price (in $1000) for a GMC pickup truck
The data is taken from Consumer’s Digest.

For Fire and Theft in Chicago 
X = fires per 100 housing units
Y = thefts per 1000 population within the same Zip code in the Chicago metro area
The data is taken from U.S Commission of Civil Rights.

For Auto Insurance in Sweden dataset
X = number of claims
Y = total payment for all the claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor
The data is taken from Swedish Committee on Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance.

For Gray Kangaroos dataset
X = nasal length (mm ¥10)
Y = nasal width (mm ¥ 10)
for a male gray kangaroo from a random sample of such animals
The data is taken from Australian Journal of Zoology, Vol. 28, p607-613.

## The Code

The Code was written in three phases
⦁	Data preprocessing phase
⦁	Training
⦁	Prediction and plotting

## The data preprocessing phase
## Imports 

Numpy import for array processing, python doesn’t have built in array support. The feature of working with native arrays can be used in python with the help of numpy library.
Pandas is a library of python used for working with tables, on importing the data, mostly data will be of table format, for ease manipulation of tables pandas library is imported
Matplotlib is a library of python used to plot graphs, for the purpose of visualizing the results we would be plotting the results with the help of matplotlib library.
Math library is import for calculating powers of numbers.

```python
# Imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math
```

## Reading the dataset from data

In this line of code using the read_excel method of pandas library, the dataset has been imported from data folder and stored in dataset variable.

```python
# Reading the dataset from data
dataset = pd.read_csv(r'..\\data\\auto_insurance.csv')
```

On viewing the dataset, it contains of two columns X and Y where X is dependent variable and Y is Independent Variable

X is an independent variable 
Y is dependent variable Inference
For x-value of 7.6 ,157 y-value 
for   x-value of 7.1 ,174 y-value
And goes on
